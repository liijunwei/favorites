# Another design

+ structure by file naming and metadata in each file(not flexiable enough), simple enough(I don't want this to be complicated, if it need to be complicated, it could have been a blog post)
or
+ structure by folder naming and metadata in each folder, can extend by adding files to that folder, similiar to initial idea, mainly differ from folder naming
